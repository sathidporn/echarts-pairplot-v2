# Wizard Feature

Implement feature for explore data

This feature used https://github.com/NattapongSiri/echarts-react-wrapper to implement echarts react component.

This feature used https://github.com/NattapongSiri/echarts-pairplot-v2 to implement pairplot.

The reason we cannot use line chart because line chart of Echarts does not support data selection nor any brush usage.
See https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#brush for more details on which type of chart support brush.

For the future we will use https://github.com/Alpha-Com-Thailand/kde_plot to implement front-end to remove outlier data by chart
